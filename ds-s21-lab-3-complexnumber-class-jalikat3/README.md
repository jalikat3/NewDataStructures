## Your definition of ADT.

ADT stands for abstract data type. It is a set of values, and a set of operations performed on those values. The values
consist of real numbers, and imaginary numbers (i). i is the square root of -1. The operations range from addition,
to multiplication, to conjugation, and everywhere in between.
